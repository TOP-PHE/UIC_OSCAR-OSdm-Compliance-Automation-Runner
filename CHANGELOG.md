## [Unreleased]

### Added
- (Phase 3 in progress)

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added — Phase 1 + 2 Audit Implementation
- **JWT secret persisted in `server_config` DB table** — sessions now survive server restarts. New `POST /v1/admin/rotate-jwt-secret` endpoint to invalidate all sessions on demand.
- **Admin Server Config UI** at `/admin.html?tab=config` — runtime-editable settings (concurrent runs, timeouts, SMTP, log level) with no restart required.
- **`LOG_LEVEL` runtime control** — admins can switch between `error/warn/info/debug/trace` from the UI; takes effect immediately.
- **Structured logging via pino** — JSON in production, pretty-printed in dev, automatic redaction of secrets.
- **Enhanced `/health` endpoint** — checks DB connectivity, queue, data dir writability, disk space, memory; returns 503 when degraded.
- **Rate limiting on `POST /v1/runs`** — 30 batches/hour/user, IPv6-safe key generator.
- **Stream backpressure on Bruno output** — caps log events to 50,000/run to prevent OOM/DB bloat.
- **HTTPS enforcement middleware** — production redirects HTTP→HTTPS, honors `X-Forwarded-Proto`.
- **Async I/O in worker** — `createWorkspace`/`cleanupWorkspace` use `fs.promises` to avoid EventLoop blocking.
- **ESLint configuration** — `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`; main branch is 0 errors / 0 warnings.

### Changed
- **Docker container runs as non-root** (`node` user, UID 1000) for security.
- **PowerShell user management script** — passwords no longer hardcoded; prompted at runtime via `Read-Host -AsSecureString`.
- **Admin password creation/reset** now requires 12+ chars with complexity (was 8 chars, no complexity) — aligned with self-registration policy.
- **Pinned dependency versions** (`~` instead of `^`) to prevent surprise minor-version breakage.

### Security
- **S1**: Subprocess env var leakage fixed (whitelist instead of `...process.env`).
- **S5**: OAuth2 error response body no longer logged (could echo client secrets).
- **S6**: Scenario code sanitized with character whitelist (path traversal hardening).
- **S8**: OAuth2 fetch has 15-second `AbortController` timeout.
- **S9**: `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` for accurate client IP behind reverse proxy.

### Fixed — Concurrent runs safety (E13/E14/E15)
- Env file name now per-run (`OTST_{slug}_{runIdShort}_Env`) — prevents collision under `MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS > 1`.
- `.bru_results.json` written to per-run path (`.bru_results_{runIdShort}.json`).
- Report scanning prefix now unique per run (automatic from env name change).

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04 (Concurrent Sessions release)

### Added
- **Parallel scenario execution** — each scenario runs as its own job, controlled by `MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS` (server-wide) and `concurrentSessionLimit` (per-company).
- **Workspace isolation on Linux** — each parallel run gets its own copy of the Bruno collection.
- **Test Manager role** — shared scenarios, batch run management.
- **Live queue panel** in the New Run UI.
- Sequential vs parallel choice removed — parallel is now the default (and only) mode.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03 (Initial production release)

### Added
- Multi-tenant company management with isolated testers.
- OAuth2 client_credentials and Bearer token auth modes.
- Self-service registration with email verification (24h token).
- Bruno CLI worker with real-time event streaming to DB.
- HTML and JSON report generation with run comparison.
- Admin UI for user/company/activity management.
- Soft-delete workflow (`DELETION_REQUESTED` → `DELETED_BY_ADMIN` → `DELETED`) with restore capability.
- AES-256-GCM encryption for company secrets at rest.
